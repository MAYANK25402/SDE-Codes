# SDE-Codes

In this Repository I am adding the codes which are very much essential for the Software Development and Testing as well.

These are some good problems which can vary from very basic to the hard level depends upon the practice of any coder.

So Check this out and Start Practice Coding ðŸ™‚.


Im Future I am also looking to add explanations to the code that I put in this repository as there are many approaches that are nor understandable to most of the people.

Also the comments will be there in the code such that it will define the code line by line or explain the format or approach used to solve the problem.
